# Migration guide for DataPower from local Docker deployment to conatainerized pods running on OpenShift

## Local Deployment

**Pre-Reqs**

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) locally on your own device.
  - If you choose to use Podman, please change the appropriate commands below from `docker` to `podman`.

**Instructions**

1. Create a folder for the project.
2. Create the following subdirectories inside this folder.
  - config
  - local
  - certs
3. Change the permissions on these sub directories.
  - Mac 
    ```
    chmod -R 777 config local certs
    ```
  - Windows 
    ```
    icacls config local certs /grant *S-1-1-0:F
    ```
4. Pull the DataPower Docker image .
   ```
   docker pull ibmcom/datapower
   ```
  - You may have to Create a [DockerID](https://hub.docker.com/).
  - And then [Login to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/).
5. Create and run the the DataPower container with an interactive shell from the local Docker image with volume mounts.
  - ```
     docker run -it â€“-name DataPower \
     -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/ibm/datapower/drouter/config \
     -v $(pwd)/local:/opt/ibm/datapower/drouter/local \
     -v $(pwd)/certs:/opt/ibm/datapower/root/secure/usrcerts \
     -e DATAPOWER_ACCEPT_LICENSE="true" \
     -e DATAPOWER_INTERACTIVE="true" \
     -p 9090:9090 \
     ibmcom/datapower
     ```
6. Enable the UI.
  - ```
    configure terminal
    ```
  - ```
    web-mgmt
    ```
  - ```
    admin-state "enabled"
    ```
  - ```
    exit
    ```
7. Access the DataPower Gateway on [https://localhost:9090](https://localhost:9090) to import the export package that contains your DataPower configuration.
8. Make any adjustments necessary if decoupling from a backend for testing purposes.
9. Once your configuration is complete, export the config as a zip file and save everything to your mounted volumes.
  - In the GUI, click 'Save Configuration'.
  - In the GUI, export the zip file.
  - In the CLI enter ```write memory```
10. Ensure that the config, local, and certs subdirectories are no longer empty.
11. Stop and delete the Docker container as well as remove the pulled DataPower Docker image if you wish.
  - ```
    docker stop -t 300 DataPower
    ```
  - ```
    docker rm DataPower
    ```
  - ```
    docker rmi ibmcom/datapower
    ```

## OpenShift Deployment

**Pre-Reqs**

1. Clone and run the [datapower-operator-scripts](https://github.com/DataPower-on-Azure/datapower-operator-scripts) repo and follow its instructions to extract the necessary yaml files.
2. An OpenShift installation on a cloud provider.
2. Login credentials and url address to access the OpenShift UI.
